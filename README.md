## Task manager web app in React.

# How to run the app locally:

1. Clone the project.
2. Make sure all the dependencies are intact. Or just in case:
> npm install 
3. Before starting the react server make sure you set up the json-server using:
> npm server
4. Now run the project (run this command in a new terminal):
> npm start 

There you go!
Thanks :)
