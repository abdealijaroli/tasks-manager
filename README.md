# Task manager web app in React.

### How to run the app locally:

1. Clone the project.
2. Make sure all the dependencies are intact. Or just in case:
  > npm install 
3. Before starting the react server make sure you set up the json-server using:
  > npm run server
4. Now run the project (run this command in a new terminal):
  > npm start 

There you go!
Thanks :)
